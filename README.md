Hello and thank you for browsing my Github.

My name is Chris and I am a first year computer science student. This program is a very simple premise with the sole point of practicing what I've learned in my classes and hopefully highlighting my continuing ability so that I may become a full time SWE.

The premise of this program is simple and silly and stems from a joke between myself and my wife. From the end of summer until the spring is in full bloom my wife and I will have the same conversation before going out. She will ask me if she should wear a sweater. Since we have differing levels of whats comfortable. Getting this question answered accurately is difficult. We mused that since we were both studying computer science we could probably make an app or something. Hence the inspiration for Sweater Whether.

At its current state it is just a class with a few functions in it so that someone could register(temporarily for now) their name and the temperature (done in Python 3). Then the when you call the method of sweater_whether, it will respond with a predetermined response on whether to wear a sweater, etc. Pointless and fun.

As one of my key projects I would like to present to future employers I do have ideas for what could be added in the future, but I don't have the skills quite yet.

Current Version:
Basic class for user input
Multiple files for organization of data, main program, and user input
